## Developing actions

Developers can create new actions in `lib/actions/` following the pattern of other actions. Remember, your action must be able to be described using JSON and **should be validated using JSON schema**.

Be sure to write a test for your action in `test/actions/`.

## Runnings tests

```
yarn build && yarn test
```
